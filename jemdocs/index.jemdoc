== About Me
I received my Ph.D. from Southwest Jiaotong University and currently is an Associate Professor and Master's Supervisor at the School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE). I have also been a Visiting Scholar at the University of York, UK, and act as an expert reviewer for the Chinese Ministry of Education’s Thesis Evaluation System. 
I am a professional member of the Chinese Association of Automation (CAA), the China Computer Federation (CCF), and IEEE, and I currently serve as a Committee Member of the CAA Technical Committee on Coexisting-Cooperative-Cognitive Robots, actively contributing to the global research community. My research primarily focuses on Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models, 
with specific interests in trustworthy machine learning, federated learning, and the theory and real-world applications of foundation models. I have published over 40 peer-reviewed papers in leading journals, including IEEE Transactions (TSP, TCSVT, TMM, TCSII), as well as top AI conferences such as NeurIPS, KDD, and WWW. As Principal Investigator, I lead research 
projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Youth Program), the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Department, and SWUFE’s Talent Introduction Research Grant. I have also contributed to several NSFC General Projects and provincial key initiatives as a core team member. I maintain close collaboration with Changjiang Distinguished Professor 
[https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/chenbd/home Badong Chen] at Xi'an Jiaotong University, and Professor [https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/people/yuriy_zakharov/ Yuriy Zakharov] at the University of York
